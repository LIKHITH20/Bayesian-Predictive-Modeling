ðŸš€ Bayesian Predictive Modeling for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Risk

This repository contains an R-based Bayesian logistic regression model for predicting 10-year CHD risk using the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The model employs prior distributions and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for posterior inference, ensuring robust uncertainty quantification and interpretability.

Key Features
Bayesian Logistic Regression: Implements hierarchical priors for structured uncertainty modeling.
MCMC Sampling: Utilizes Gibbs Sampling & Metropolis-Hastings to estimate posterior distributions.
Feature Selection & Model Diagnostics: Identifies significant predictors (age, systolic BP, cholesterol, smoking intensity) while optimizing Effective Sample Size (ESS), Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE), and shrink factor.
Performance Optimization: Achieved 84.8% accuracy, high recall, and well-calibrated posterior distributions.
ðŸ“Š Technologies: Bayesian Inference, Logistic Regression, MCMC Sampling, Posterior Analysis, Feature Selection, Model Calibration, R (rstan, bayesplot, ggplot2, dplyr).

ðŸ”— Usage: Clone the repo, preprocess the dataset, run Bayesian inference, and analyze posterior distributions. Suitable for predictive modeling, healthcare risk assessment, and Bayesian statistical analysis.
